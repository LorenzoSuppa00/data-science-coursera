# Python Program to Count words in a String using Dictionary
# def freq(string):
    
#     #step1: A list variable is declared and initialized to an empty list.
#     words = []
    
#     #step2: Break the string into list of words
#     words = string.split() # or string.lower().split()
    
#     #step3: Declare a dictionary
#     Dict = {}
    
#     #step4: Use for loop to iterate words and values to the dictionary
#     for key in words:
#         Dict[key] = words.count(key) #!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
        
#     #step5: Print the dictionary
#     print("The Frequency of words is:",Dict)
    
# #step6: Call function and pass string in it
# freq("Mary had a little lamb Little lamb, little lamb Mary had a little lamb.Its fleece was white as snow And everywhere that Mary went Mary went, Mary went \
# Everywhere that Mary went The lamb was sure to go")
